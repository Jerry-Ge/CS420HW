Notice: All my code compiles and runs in Mac OS. 
		The Pic lib must be compiled before main code
		
Instructions for compiling and running my program:
-Use Makefile, type "make", to compile all the code
-Run program assign1 providing with a filename of jpg image in command line (e.g. "./assign1 spiral.jpg")
-You will see a window(640 by 480),at the top left corner on your screen.

Instructions for playing with my program:
-If you want the scene to rotate during idle, push space bar once, then the scene will keep rotating
 push space bar again, it will stop.

-For Rotation, drag mouse on the scene, if you can't rotate by doing that, holding key '1' then drag mouse.

-For translation, keep holding key '2', drag mouse on the scene, then it will do x-y axis translation.

-For scale, keep holding key 'shift' or '3', drag mouse on the scene, then it will scale bigger or smaller respectively

-Change rendering mode
	POINTS MODE: Press key 'P' once.
	LINE-LOOP (wireframe) MODE: Press key 'W' once.
	TRIANGLE (Fill) MODE: Press key "T" once.

-Take Screen shots and create animation
	Press key 'X', then it will take 300 screen shots in 20 seconds.


Codes and Folders:
-All codes in assign1.cpp
-JPG frame outputs in folder "imageOutput"
-I also created a video named "hw1-demo", to show all my work.
-You can also check a video "demo-funy" which rendered an Einstein for fun
